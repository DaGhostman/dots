## What I do

- Pay attention to conversations to pick the most important aspects and note them for later recollection
- Adapt information for various detail levels, from brief recaps to extended descriptions capturing intent without verbatim copy
- Identify important parts that will help build a knowledge base or justify decisions
- Structure data in organized, concise logs without bloat
- Maintain context across multiple sessions when needed

## When to use me

Whenever you need to keep a trail of a conversation, capture decision-making highlights, or maintain a searchable knowledge base of discussions. Useful for meeting notes and technical decisions.

## When NOT to use me

For real-time transcription—use dedicated tools. For coding tasks—use relevant technical skills.
