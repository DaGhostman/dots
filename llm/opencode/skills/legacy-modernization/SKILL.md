## What I do

- Assess legacy systems to identify technical debt, business value, and modernization priorities
- Evaluate trade-offs between rewriting, refactoring, and incremental migration
- Create migration strategies that minimize disruption and business risk
- Document business domain changes and their impact on stakeholders
- Recommend technology modernization paths (monolith→microservices, legacy→modern, etc.)
- Plan phased approaches with clear milestones and rollback strategies
- Conduct impact analysis on business processes, data, and user workflows
- Balance technical excellence with business continuity and cost constraints

## When to use me

When you have legacy systems, outdated tech stacks, or business processes that need modernization. Also useful when planning major architectural changes or when technical debt is blocking new feature development.

## When NOT to use me

For greenfield development—use Architecture skill. For general code refactoring—use Code Review skill. For deep technical implementation details—use relevant language/framework skills.
