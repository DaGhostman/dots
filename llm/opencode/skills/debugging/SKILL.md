## What I do

- Analyze stack traces, error messages, and application logs
- Identify root causes using systematic debugging methodology
- Reproduce issues in controlled environments
- Suggest fixes with clear explanations and validate the solution
- Apply fixes safely without introducing regressions

## When to use me

When you encounter unexpected behavior, crashes, panics, or inconsistent outputs and need structured debugging assistance. Also useful when you're stuck and need a fresh perspective on a elusive bug.

## When NOT to use me

When the issue is clearly architectural or requires significant refactoring—use Architecture skill instead.
