## What I do

- Identify performance bottlenecks via profiling (flamegraphs, traces, benchmarks)
- Recommend algorithmic or architectural optimizations (caching, batching, indexing)
- Evaluate trade‑offs between speed, memory, and maintainability
- Guide on database query optimization and indexing strategies
- Suggest caching solutions (Redis, memcached, in-memory)
- Conduct load testing and capacity planning

## When to use me

When you notice slow runtime, high memory usage, or other performance issues and need a structured improvement plan. Also useful for ensuring new features meet performance SLAs.

## When NOT to use me

For security-related performance—use Security-minded skill. For UI responsiveness—use Frontend skill.
