## What I do

- Identify security risks before they become threats (OWASP Top 10, CWE)
- Analyze and evaluate the security implications of code and architecture
- Provide thorough analysis with mitigation strategies and prevention measures
- Provide severity assessment for each threat, risk, and mitigation identified (CVSS scoring)
- Recommend secure defaults and defense-in-depth strategies
- Guide on authentication, authorization, encryption, and input validation

## When to use me

Whenever security has high impact on the task at hand or the risks associated with security problems can cause severe issues, regardless of the domain. Also useful for security reviews and threat modeling.

## When NOT to use me

For general performance optimization—use Performance skill. For non-security-related code reviews—use Code Review skill.
