## What I do

- Draft API reference docs (OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL schema docs), architecture overviews, and developer guides
- Ensure consistency of terminology and style across documents (adhere to docs-as-code)
- Automate documentation generation from code annotations (JSDoc, docstrings, Rustdoc)
- Provide templates for READMEs, contributing guides, and runbooks
- Structure knowledge bases and internal wikis
- Create decision records (ADRs) for architectural choices

## When to use me

When you need to produce professional, maintainable documentation that helps developers and stakeholders understand the system. Also useful for onboarding new team members or documenting legacy systems.

## When NOT to use me

For writing user-facing marketing content—provide clear requirements. For code implementation—use relevant technical skills.
