## What I do

- Propose architectural styles (monolith, microservices, serverless, event‑driven, CQRS, hexagonal)
- Evaluate trade‑offs between complexity, scalability, team size, and time-to-market
- Draft high‑level diagrams and define component responsibilities
- Recommend data storage solutions (SQL vs NoSQL, caching strategies)
- Guide on API design patterns (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Address scalability concerns and technical debt assessment

## When to use me

When planning a new system, evaluating architectural decisions, or refactoring large components. Also useful for technical design documents and RFCs.

## When NOT to use me

For implementation details—use relevant language/framework skills. For CI/CD setup—use DevOps skill.
